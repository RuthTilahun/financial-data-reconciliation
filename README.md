## 🎯 Project Overview

A production-grade data quality pipeline that consolidates financial data from multiple sources (SEC EDGAR, Alpha Vantage API, analyst reports), reconciles conflicting information, detects anomalies, and ensures data accuracy for investment analysis.

**Problem:** Investment firms rely on data from dozens of sources with inconsistent formats, naming conventions, and update schedules. Manual reconciliation is time-consuming and error-prone.

**Solution:** Automated pipeline that ingests, validates, cleans, reconciles, and monitors financial data across multiple sources—delivering a single, trusted dataset for analysis.

### Business Context

This project simulates data operations work performed at fintech companies like **Arch**, which consolidate alternative investment data from 100+ fund portals. While this implementation uses public market data (more accessible), the **reconciliation challenges and skills are identical**:

| This Project | Fintech Data Operations (e.g., Arch) |
|--------------|--------------------------------------|
| SEC filings + market APIs + analyst reports | Fund portals + K-1s + capital call notices |
| Company name variations | Fund name variations across portals |
| Revenue/earnings reconciliation | Position/valuation reconciliation |
| Ticker standardization | CUSIP/ISIN standardization |
| Quarterly data updates | Capital calls, distributions, statements |
| 3 data sources | 100+ fund portals |

## 🔍 Key Components

### 1. Data Collection (`src/collection.py`)
Automated ingestion from multiple sources:
```python
collector = FinancialDataCollector(alpha_vantage_key='YOUR_KEY')
sec_data, av_data, analyst_data = collector.run_full_collection(tickers)
```

**Features:**
- SEC EDGAR API integration
- Alpha Vantage rate limiting handling
- Synthetic messy data generation
- Timestamp tracking for audit trail

### 2. Data Validation (`src/validation.py`)
20+ validation rules:
```python
validator = FinancialDataValidator()
issues = validator.run_all_validations(df, dataset_name='SEC_EDGAR')
```

**Checks:**
- ✅ Completeness (missing critical fields)
- ✅ Consistency (cross-field validation)
- ✅ Accuracy (range validation)
- ✅ Uniqueness (duplicate detection)
- ✅ Timeliness (data freshness)
- ✅ Format (standardization)

### 3. Reconciliation (`src/reconciliation.py`)
Entity resolution across sources:
```python
reconciler = CompanyReconciliation()
golden_df = reconciler.full_reconciliation_workflow(sec_df, av_df, analyst_df)
```

**Methods:**
- 🎯 Exact ticker matching (100% success)
- 🔍 Fuzzy name matching (85%+ threshold)
- 🏆 Golden record creation (best from each source)
- 📝 Complete data lineage tracking

## 📝 Interview Talking Points

### "Tell me about a data quality project you've worked on."

*"I built an automated pipeline that reconciles financial data from three independent sources—SEC filings, market data APIs, and analyst reports. The key challenge was entity resolution: the same company appears with different names across sources, like 'Alphabet Inc.' vs 'Google Inc.' I implemented fuzzy matching with an 85% threshold and achieved a 100% automated match rate for companies with ticker symbols. For revenue discrepancies, I developed logic to average values when differences are small (<5%) and flag larger discrepancies for investigation. The pipeline reduced manual reconciliation time by 89%."*

### "How do you handle missing data?"

*"I use field-specific strategies based on criticality. For essential fields like ticker or company name, I drop records—we can't analyze data without identifiers. For financial metrics like revenue, I flag missing values but keep the record, since partial data is still useful. Every decision is documented in the audit trail."*

### "How do you ensure data quality in production?"

*"I built a multi-layered approach: First, validation rules run on ingestion—20+ checks for completeness, accuracy, consistency. Second, automated anomaly detection catches outliers using Z-scores and IQR methods. Third, a monitoring dashboard shows real-time quality metrics. Fourth, an alert system notifies of critical issues. Finally, every transformation is logged for audit trail."*
